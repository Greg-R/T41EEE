### Version T41EEE.3 T41 Software Defined Transceiver Arduino Sketch

This is the "T41 Extreme Experimenter's Edition" software for the 
T41 Software Defined Transceiver.  The T41EEE was "forked" from the V049.2 version
of the T41-EP software.  T41EEE is fundamentally different from the mainstream T41-EP
code in that it adopts C++ rather than C.  C++ language features will be gradually
introduced in the next releases.

T41EEE will be hosted at this public Github repository:

<https://github.com/Greg-R/T41EEE>

I don't plan on publishing periodic releases.  The repository will be updated as bug fixes
and feature enhancements become available.  You will be able to update and FLASH your radio
with the revised software quickly.

Please note that the configuration structure is different than the predecessor V049.2
It is recommended to perform a full FLASH erase before loading T41EEE.1.

You will need to install the ArduinoJSON library by Benoit Blanchon.  Using the IDE:
Tools -> Manage Libraries ...
Search for ArduinoJSON.  Note this is a single word, as there is another library
with the name Arduino_JSON, which is not the correct library.  Install the library,
and if you have the other dependencies for the V049.2 version, compilation will be
successful.

## Highlight of Features included in T41EEE.3

No new features are introduced in T41EEE.3.  This is a "clean-up" version.

1.  Removal of extraneous #define statements.
2.  Removal of unused variables.
3.  Global variables which do not require global access are moved to their individual
    files and are no longer extern (removed from SDT.h).
4.  Some larger arrays are now DMAMEM.  This moves them to RAM2, thereby increasing the
    stack size.
