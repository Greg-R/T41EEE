The following change log documents changes to versions prior to the current.

## Highlight of Features included in T41EEE.2

Thank you to Jonathan KN6LFB and Harry GM3RVL for their contributions to the T41EEE code!

1.  Harry GM3RVL version of ShowSpectrum() inserted which includes automatic RF gain control
2.  Added On/Off for AutoGain.
3.  Converted to ArduinoJson 7 and some house cleaning.
4.  Added EEPROMWrite to key selections and paddle flip.
5.  Disable button presses during transmit. Buttons are still read and "processed", so that interrupt-driven button repeats are cleared,
    but they are not "executed".  By Jonathan KN6LFB.
6.  Modified ResetHistograms to use the already-calculated transmitDitLength, and not to reset the current keyer speed to 15wpm. Since
    the keyer speed is not being modified, there is also no reason to call UpdateWPMField.  By Jonathan KN6LFB.
7.  Added new array for RF gain value per band.
8.  Auto-gain works independently of manual RF gain per band.
9.  Added EEPROMWrite() to SetWPM().
10. Set autogain to false by default.

## Highlight of Features included in T41EEE.1

Thank you to Jonathan KN6LFB for the major improvement in button functionality!

1.  Switch matrix buttons are changed from polling to interrupts for improved performance.
2.  The new button code includes a tunable variable for button response time.  This variable
    is added to the calibration menu as BTN REPEAT.  The default value should be a good
    starting point.  If button response is too fast, increase the BTN REPEAT value.
3.  The switch matrix calibration routine is added to the calibration menu.
4.  Switch matrix calibration is easier and precise.  It is possible to push a button
    and hold it.  It will not skip to the next button.  In practice, a short, firm push
    on each button in the proper series will rapidly complete the process.
5.  EEPROM start-up code is significantly revised.

## Highlight of Features included in T41EEE.0.  December 2023

1.  The configuration file stored on the SD card is changed to JSON format.
2.  New selections in the EEPROM menu allow serial readout of configuration data
    from the stack, the EEPROM, the SD card, and the hard-coded defaults.
3.  The Morse decoder is coded in a state-machine design pattern.
4.  The sidetone quality is improved.  Thank you to Jonathan KN6LFB for this very
    excellent improvement!
5.  The user can now select from 4 different discrete CW offset tone frequencies.
    The new selections are in the CW Options menu.
6.  Spectrum zooms of 8X and 16X bugs are resolved and these zooms are functioning.
7.  Transmit calibration can be done with either a 750 Hz or 3 kHz tone.  This new
    selection is in the Calibration Options menu.  Calibration code is simplified
    and this should result in better quality calibration.
8.  The configuration file includes variables for frequency divider (quadrature
    generator) hardware.  The values of 4 work with the original T41 QSD and QSE
    boards.
9.  Volume control is changed to one-hundred 1 dB steps.
10. Audio chain management is significantly enhanced, and less audio memory is required.
    Thank you to Jonathan KN6LFB for this major improvement!
11. CW keyer timing optimizations including CW envelope shaping.  Another great one from
    Jonathan KN6LFB!

   RAM2: variables:328544  free for malloc/new:195744

V047a July 3, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE)
  1. Started work on the use of a user configuration file. Added new struct to hold map names, longitude, latitude.
  2. Added code to allow for up to 10 map files for different QTHs. They appear below starting at approximately line 300.
  3. Added new menu, Bearing, to the front of the menu list. It allows you to select the map file to use in bearing calculations
  4. Push button 18 activates the bearing calculation. Assumes the file has already been selected. Press 18 again when done. 17 backspaces.
  5. Removed several debugging Serial.print() calls.
  6. Refactored code in numerous places.
  7. FIxed the wonky color problem if you entered a call prefix that doesn't exist.
  8. Moved several symbolic constants from SDT.h to MyCOnfigurationFile.h.
  FLASH: code:232980, data:144160, headers:8900   free for files:7740424

   RAM2: variables:328544  free for malloc/new:195744

V046f July 1, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE)
  1. Changed FREQ_SEP_CHARACTER in SDT.h to comma as use in FormatFrequency() in Display.cpp, near line 648
  2. Removed unused and duplicated symbolic constants.
  FLASH: code:233428, data:144160, headers:8452   free for files:7740424

   RAM2: variables:328544  free for malloc/new:195744

V046e June 30, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE) and includes changes by Greg:
  1. Changed the way EEPROM works at startup. It reads the EEPROM and then checks to see if the version numbers match. If so, control
     returns to setup() and continues. IF EEPROM is virgin or has a value in the switch matrix that doesn't make sense. The code is
     the last function in EEPROM.cpp and is heavily commented.

   RAM2: variables:328544  free for malloc/new:195744

V046d June 27, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE) and includes changes by Greg:
  1. Added Greg's changes to fix the SSB flip
  2. Fixed sync indicators for EEPROM and SD. Those variables stored in EEPROM may differ from their 
     current values (e.g. WPM) and this causes the EEPROM sync indicator to turn on. SD is RED for no
     SD card, green otherwise.
  3. During calibrate, automatically switch to CW mode and set spectrum scale to 10 dB
  4. Changed menu index on startup to 0. This allows for Menu Down to get to Calibrate option quickly.
  5. Formattted power out to use only 1 decimal place
  FLASH: code:231284, data:144320, headers:8388   free for files:7742472
   RAM1: variables:227616, code:227736, padding:1640   free for local variables:67296
   RAM2: variables:328544  free for malloc/new:195744

 V046c June 25, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE) and includes changes by Greg:
  1. Added symbolic constant UPDATE_SWITCH_MATRIX that is set to 1 by default, which means run the switch calibration code. If set to 0,
     the call to update the switch values is bypassed and the values stored in EEPROM are used. 
  2. Removed the call to EEPROMSaveDefaults() from EEPROMStartup() because the defaults would be overwritten if just the version number 
    was changed. If the user wants to save the defaults, they can uncomment the call in setup().
  FLASH: code:231284, data:144320, headers:8388   free for files:7742472

 V046b June 16, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE) and includes changes by Greg:
  1.  Add PROGMEM to line 97 in Bearing.cpp (John's change).
  2.  In EEPROM.cpp, change the strcpy function to strncpy in 2 places.  Add the parameter 10 as the third parameter.  Do this on lines 18 and 160.
  3.  In SDTVer045.ino, change line 1032 to:
      int EEPROMData.AGCMode = 30;
  4.  In SDTVer045.ino, comment line 698, thereby removing the global variable audioTemp.
      Also remove it from line 673 of SDT.h (the extern).
      Next, add this line
      int audioTemp;
      to the function DoCWReceiveProcessing in CWProcessing.cpp.
      This is line 40 (remove the commented line).
  5.  in SDTVer045.ino, remove two calls to the function SetFreq() at lines 2493 and 2617.
  6.  Add new buffer play code in the file Process2.cpp at line 360.
  7.  Remove redundant call to ShowSpectrum() at line 246.
  8. Fixed warning of uninitialized use of R[]. It actually was initialized via a pointer, 
     but the compiler doesn't recognize that. Used memset() call in DSP_Fn.cpp, line 103.
     Unneeded, but it bugged me (JJP).
  9. Change Fine Tune increment so it may have values 10, 50, 250, and 500. Press the Fine Tune inrement button
     and it advances to the next value and wraps at the end. EEPROM sync indicator displayed to show this value
     is different than what's in EEPROM. Use meu EEPROM-->Save Current to persist it.
  10. Fixed the "ghosting" image after CW xmit is finished.

 V045 May 12, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE):
    fixed: Al reviewed, fixed, and test all of the Calibrate routines 
    fixed: The IDEs compiler was replaced with the latest incarnation, leading to an increase in the number of warnings. We have fixed those where possible. (Some can't be because of the way the parser works.)
    fixed: The fine tune increment is now stored in EEPROM

  V040a Feb 01, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE):
    Fixed: used wrong character array for first member of the CopyEEPROMToSD() routine. 
    Added: to main increment 100,000 and 1,000,000 to allow faster moves in frequency (i.e., Calibrate on WWV)
    Fixed: Calibration called the wrong function. Now calls the correct function.

  V039 Jan 11, 2023  Jack Purdum (W8TEE):
    Activated SD card for EEPROM data and BMP file for bearing mapping. Bearing mapping requires
    creating a BMP file which is copied onto the SD card. The name of the file appears at line

    Fixed: "AGC" removed from Info Window when turned off: WHITE = Slow, ORANGE = Medium, GREEN = FAST, RED = AGC in action
    Fixed: Part of "T41-EP" in upper-right corner partially erased when doing certain screen updates.
    Fixed: Text under VFO A partially erased on certain screen updates.
    Fixed: Switching modes caused filter overlay to disappear.
